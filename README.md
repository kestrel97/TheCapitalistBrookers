Ease of access and efficiency is everyone’s preference but when this ease brings monetary hazards, then a
person prefers to stay away from it. Same goes with bank accounts these days, where banks provide a bunch
of facilities and services to make customer’s financial management easier, they also bring some anxieties in
customer’s peace of mind such as a customer has to visit a certain branch of the bank in order to open his
account, due to this hassle and security risks, various customers prefer not to open bank accounts at all. This prototype project will address this issue and eliminate the need for the physical presence of the customer in
